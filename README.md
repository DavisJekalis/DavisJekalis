ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! I'm a C# enthusiast and software developer, with a passion for coding and problem-solving, <br>
Passionate about creating efficient and intuitive software solutions, I'm always eager to dive into new challenges. ðŸ˜Š<br>
<br>
I've crafted two exciting projects using my favorite tools:<br>
<br>
[1. Scooter Rental Class Library](https://github.com/DavisJekalis/Scooter-Rental "Scooter Rental")<br>
Created a robust class library for scooter rentals using C#.<br>
Implemented unit testing to ensure the reliability of the code.<br>
Simulated real-world scooter rental operations, managing usage time and rental costs efficiently.<br>
Engineered features for generating annual income reports.<br>
<br>
[2. FlightPlanner WebAPI with SQL Database](https://github.com/DavisJekalis/FlightPlanner "Flight Planner")<br>
Developed a powerful FlightPlanner WebAPI using C# with Entity Framework.<br>
Designed a SQL database to store flight and airport data.<br>
Implemented search functionality, allowing users to find flights using various search phrases.<br>
Ensured accurate input and output values through rigorous testing with Postman.<br>
Implemented basic operations, including retrieving flights, deleting flights, and clearing the entire storage.<br>

[3. Azure Data scraper](https://github.com/DavisJekalis/Scraper "Data Scraper")<br>
Azure Function that runs on a timer trigger, fetches random data from a public API, 
creates a log entry in a table storage based on the API response status, 
and uploads the API response content as a JSON file to a blob storage.
